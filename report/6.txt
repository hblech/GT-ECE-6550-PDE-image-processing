6) Finally, discuss what we have learned (beyond what was already covered in
lecture) as a result of your project. This can be both positive and negative.
In otherwords, you may have discovered a weakness as well as a strength in
your PDE based approach while doing your experiments. Try to relate the
strengths and/or weakness discovered during your experimental testing to
the assumptions (or lack of assumptions) made in the mathematical formulation
of your problem. In the case of weakness, suggest what you might do in
the future if you had more time to reformulate, adjust, or improve your
model and/or your discrete implementation algorithm.
