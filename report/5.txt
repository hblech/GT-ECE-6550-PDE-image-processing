5) Now present some experimental results from applying your discretized
PDE methods on data. The data can be synthetically generated or real data
(real data is not important for this project). If you are exploring more
than one PDE model (and/or testing the effect of changing some parameters in
your PDE model), then make sure you present multiple experimental results.
Attempt to extract/present some quantitative information to compare results
rather than just showing only images. For example, if you are doing anisotropic
image diffusing to preserve edges, you can devise any sort of reasonable
quantitative measure to compare the edge preservation effects between
different PDE choices, and then present a table of the comparisons (or a plot
showing the way this value changes with the number of PDE iterations for
each choice of your PDE).
