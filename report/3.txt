3) Next, show how the PDE you intend to use to solve your problem is derived
or formulated from your mathematical model. For example, in the case you are
using a variational gradient descent PDE, here is where you will show how to
obtain your gradient flow PDE from the energy function that you already
presented. Make sure it is clear to me that you understand how the PDE is
obtained (don't just present it with no explanation).
